## FINAL PROJECT

A study was conducted to examine certain parameters related to mental and physical health and their impact on productivity. A questionnaire was developed and distributed in order to collect real-world data, yielding responses from all districts nationwide. Using Microsoft Excel, an Exploratory Data Analysis was performed, which included a prior characterization of both the sample and the population under study.

In addition, statistical tests were carried out using SPSS software, including location tests such as the Sign Test, and independence tests such as the Chi-Square Test and the Likelihood Ratio Test.

Residual analysis and parameter estimation were also performed, and conclusions were drawn regarding the study, taking into account its limitations and the requirements necessary to achieve more robust results in the future.
